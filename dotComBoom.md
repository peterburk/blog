# Dot Com Boom

The Internet has a reputation for Rule 34. Our primary school had no censorship at the time, and I became known as the one who knew how to erase web history. While I’d seen my parents using NCSA Mosaic, it was Netscape Navigator and Altavista on a Performa 5200 that introduced me to the real Web. Eventually our 6th grade teacher realised, but we were given an honest talk rather than disciplinary procedures.

Having been introduced so young, my conscience was still sensitive. After a year or two, I realised how addictive that industry is, and decided to try to stop. It was not easy, but by the grace of God, I stopped looking at those websites. To this day I think it was one of the most difficult, but significant decisions I’ve made.

The iMac was Apple’s re-entry into the mainstream. When the internet-Mac was first introduced, both my school and church bought it. With a built-in 56K modem and USB, but no SCSI or floppy drive, the iMac began the future of the Web. But despite the handle, it was not portable.

My parents waited until the iMac DV one year later. And with my old Mac Plus not being online, I was still following these updates in MacFormat magazine. A consumer portable was coming. Would it be a newer eMate 300? What new features would it bring?

The iBook took the world, and my backpack, by storm. When I entered secondary school in 2000, my parents generously gave me one. The upgrade to me was phenomenal: Mac OS 9.0.4 instead of System 7.0.1, 6 GB instead of 250 MB of disk space, and 192 MB instead of 4 MB of RAM. It was useful for typing reports in science class, and filled my free time with Nanosaur and Bugdom. Even better, I could use it while in bed, or sitting on the toilet. Some things haven’t changed.

AirPort was the most significant addition. Although our IDSN home internet connection could only fill 128 kbps by this time, I had a wireless card capable of 11 Mbps built into my laptop! Even my dad was jealous that the antenna was built-in, since he was still using a PCMCIA card.
