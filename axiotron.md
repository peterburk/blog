# Axiotron

For going to university, my parents kindly treated me to another laptop upgrade. Moving from a 6-year old iBook G3 to the latest MacBook Pro 15” was huge. iTunes didn’t take 10 minutes to open! I could use watch DVDs! But having amused myself with text-based forums and news sites for years, video has been slower to influence my life.

The most brutal hit came at the start of the first term. At a Saosin concert in Manchester, my bag was stolen. Suddenly, I no longer had my Canon PowerShot A620 digital camera from 2006, nor the Pocket PC, nor my brand-new 160 GB iPod Classic. My Nokia was in my pocket, but the rest of my devices were gone.

Rather than using my Pocket PC as a laptop replacement, I then had to carry my MacBook Pro around with me. Since then, I’ve grown accustomed to having it in my bag, and the weight doesn’t bother me like it used to.

It took all year to save up to replace the system, and I had to do so within a student budget. Although the iPhone was new, I was still loyal to the Windows Mobile apps I’d accumulated, and wanted a full keypad on my phone. So I chose an HP iPaq 640c. Even now, I miss the upgradable memory and replaceable battery it offered.

My iPod repairing fell quiet at university, since I only marketed it by word-of-mouth. I replaced a headphone port on an iPod Video, but that was all. But my interest in web forums returned.

Axiotron created the first Tablet Mac by replacing a MacBook screen with a higher-resolution one, and overlaying a Wacom digitiser. Best of Show in MacWorld 2007, I was fascinated by the technology after my Digital Picture Frame mod. So I read their support forums, and saw many unanswered questions. Quickly, I learned enough about the product to answer them, and wrote about 50 posts before emailing in my CV.

To my amazement, they accepted me for a summer internship in Los Angeles! It was my first and favourite job. I disassembled the new MacBook Air and mapping out its internal wire connections. I wrote many AppleScripts, including one to use the built-in GPS and SkyHook API to tag every edited document with a location, and place it on a Google Earth map. And I was appointed to be a moderator on their forum! But one of the best perks was a ride in the founder’s boat, off the coast of Malibu.
