# Digital Native

“When did you first get a computer in your house?”

Recently, I asked several friends this question. Their answers vary, but mostly fall between 1995 and 2000, with peoples’ ages between 7 and 12. The younger generation using technology from birth is sometimes viewed with disdain, as ignorant and naïve.

 

I believe I am the oldest member of this younger generation, the first digital native. The photo above shows me using my dad’s computer in 1991, at age 1.

 

Three important things happened in 1989. Many things happened, but I will focus on three. Tim Berners-Lee developed the World Wide Web at CERN in March, although it went through a few revisions before public release. Apple released the Macintosh Portable in September, the first GUI capable laptop computer. And not least, I was born!

 

That means I’ve never known life without the World Wide Web, LCD screens, a GUI interface, and laptops. Even my dad’s old Epson HX-20 was still command-line based.

 

It happens that I grew up in Geneva, and my dad works in the IT division of CERN. He was actively posting to Usenet, the first Internet message board, since 1986. The oldest modem still in our house is a Gandalf LDS125, but the oldest useful one is a US Robotics Sportster 14.4 kbps. I think we used a 9600 bps at one point, but can’t remember the model. But I know my dad would sometimes work from home for as long as I can remember.

 

So what? It’s just a matter of perspective. For me, productivity can be measured in megabytes. My computer is my phone, my TV, my stereo, and always has been. There’s no place like 127.0.0.1.
