# iPhone and Wildmind

After my summer job at HealthDiplomats, I went on a Trans-Siberian train journey. The relief from an Internet connection was welcome, and I finally had a good excuse for not answering my email for a couple of weeks. The trip was partly inspired by Helmut Uttenthaler’s Vienna-Pyongyang blog. Unfortunately, the North Korea part of the trip had to be cancelled for reasons outside my control, which led me to visit Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Taiwan is a wonderful place. With high quality of life, cheap prices, good food, electronics companies, mountains, beaches, indie rock, and Christian bookstores, it left a great impression on me. As well as manufacturing MOSFETs, they even make edible MOS chips! So I set my heart on returning.

Back in Lancaster, I was very involved in student societies, including political, Christian, and international groups. Disappointed that they were all organising events at the same time, I dreamed of a better solution. It was the start of the Lancaster Leaflets idea.

I gained confidence in passing out flyers for those societies. So I started LUSARS, a Mac repair business in Lancaster, with nothing but a Facebook group and a basic flyer. Over the year, I met with 18 customers, fixing all kinds of basic problems or taking in-warranty machines to the Apple Store.

My MacBook Pro was 3 years old, and ailing rapidly. It went through 7 different repairs over its warranty period, with the motherboard, top case, SuperDrive, battery, and RAM each replaced at least once. AppleCare kindly deemed me an exceptional circumstance, and upgraded me to a new 15” unibody MBP! I’m not happy about the lack of replaceable battery or non-standard mini DisplayPort, but it’s lighter and a lot more reliable than the previous model.

Through societies I met Grace, an exchange student from Taiwan. She introduced me to PTT, a command-line BBS still in active use by students there. Although I couldn’t read the traditional characters, she helped me find my next summer job using that forum. It was the second time a web forum led to work!

Wildmind is an iPhone app developer in Taipei. Weeks before leaving, I realised I needed an iPhone. Although I’d repaired a few, I still didn’t own one. So via eBay, I bought my current iPhone 3G 8 GB for only £90! Skeptical about the lack of a real keyboard, I hesitantly put it in my pocket. It’s never left since.

My work at Wildmind involved expanding the market for Fanwave, their TV guide app beyond Taiwan to the rest of the world. My first AppleScript-based channel guide downloader had too slow a runtime, so I rewrote the script in bash. I also learned the Facebook API, allowing me to put all my iPhone-using friends into a List for easy Page invites.

The MRT subway takes 20 minutes to cross Taipei, a commute I did twice a day. Watching my fellow commuters playing iPhone games, I wanted to use mine more usefully in this time. Laptops aren’t appropriate for subways, but iPhones are. Using only iFile and MobileTerminal, I applied my shell scripting knowledge during those journeys to slowly create my first app: a Bible reader automatically linking to my daily reading, based on preferences. Unlike my iPaq, the iPhone screen resolution is high enough to make reading possible. I use that script daily for my Bible reading, whether on my iPhone or screen-rotated MacBook Pro.
