# Geek Parables

I have been considering producing my own Bible paraphrase for a while, applying analogies in the style of metageography (https://github.com/peterburk/ideas/blob/master/metageography.md) to make parables more accessible to those in a background of computer science. Here’s my first piece.

John 15:1-17

Jesus, the root node

1″I am the root node, and my Father is the operating system.  2He garbage-collects every leaf node with no children, and he indexes and formally verifies the nodes that do have children so they will produce even more.  3You have already been indexed for increasing your size by the message I have given you.  4Retain in me, and I will retain in you. For a node cannot change its out-degree if it is severed from its parent node, and you cannot assign your left and right pointers apart from me.

5″Yes, I am the root node; you are the child nodes. Those who retain in me, and I in them, will increase the height of the tree. For apart from me you can do nothing.  6Anyone who parts from me has their pointer removed like a useless leaf and is lost on the heap. Such leaves are garbage-collected into a pile to be deallocated.  7But if you stay joined to me and my words remain in you, you may ask any request you like, and it will be granted!  8My true disciples raise their out-degree greatly. This brings great glory to my Father.

9″I have loved you even as the Father has loved me. Retain in my love.  10When you compile, you retain in my love, just as I execute for my Father and retain in his love.  11I have told you this so that you will be filled with my joy. Yes, your stack of joy will overflow!  12I command you to love each other in the same way that I love you.  13And here is how to measure it–the greatest love is shown when people terminate their own process to free up RAM for their friends.  14You are my friends if you compile.  15I no longer call you functions, because a calling process (in Pascal) doesn’t receive return variables from his functions. Now you are my friends, since I have told you everything the Father told me.  16You didn’t call me. I called you. I gave you the task to go and produce child nodes that will last, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask for, if you use sudo.  17I command you to love each other.
