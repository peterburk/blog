My life in technology.

If you’ve just reached my blog, welcome!

This is a short history of my life in technology. It describes how I’ve grown from lying in bed using a laptop in 1991 when I was 1-2 years old, to the present day.

Before I begin, though, all glory to God for blessing me with the life I’m describing to you. He planned it before I was even made, and it’s his will I want to follow every day, not my own!
