# Heritage of Generations

I need to turn this into infographics.

It’s been a while since I wrote! These floods of thoughts only come occasionally though. Right now I’m visiting my Gran in Bridlington, UK, and learned some interesting facts to bring more perspective.

Gran, Marguerite Dustman, is 89 years old. Despite having grown up in a very different world, we have remarkably similar personalities, for better and worse. This personality deserves a separate blog post, which I might write soon.

She mentioned something that fascinated me, though. Her brother Arthur Christie was an electrical engineer! He moved from Bradford to Liverpool in 1926 to work for English Electric, as a 17 year-old apprentice.

Gran’s father was a school headmaster, and had trained as a teacher at a college in Birmingham. Her mother suffered from deafness, which has been partially passed down to Gran and my mother. My great-grandmother would go out to sit in the library’s reading room with Gran, and the appeal of libraries has continued.

Her grandfather raised his children in Hull, by the North Sea. He had dreams of being a sailor, but his parents refused. He would regularly move house every 3 years, and never settled for long. Gran shares the love of the sea, especially of Flamborough. I have also inherited the love of travel, and enjoy the expanse of sea and sky.

His father – Gran’s great-grandfather – was a sailor. He was born in Scotland, into the Christie clan. Gran could remember no more about him, but it seems the urge to travel goes back at least six generations from me.

6 generations of educated, well-travelled people. And I thought my independence was a personal choice. How has technology changed? Gran was born in 1922. Arthur was born in 1909. English Electric was founded in 1918, and later bought Marconi (est. 1897).

Gran calls herself a late adopter of technology. She was reluctant to get a telephone until the 1980s, and continues to avoid computers. But she is passionate about her bicycle, calling it a “friend for life.” The first modern bicycle, Starley’s Rover, was invented in 1885, 37 years before she was born. By comparison, 37 years before I was born was 1952. The first stages of Internet development were in 1962, and life without it is still recent history.

Alan Kay’s Dynabook concept describes a computer similar to the iPad. It was imagined in 1968. There was a 42 year delay before technology caught up. The inventor is still alive to see it happen, at 71. He worked at Apple’s ATG, the birthplace of AppleScript. Research is essential for progress, but Steve Jobs closed ATG in 1997. Studying tech history and the research they did just might lead to the next big thing! The Newton was released in 1993, providing iPhone technology 14 years ahead of the real thing.

Gran’s father, the headmaster, was born in 1881. His father, who moved every 3 years, will have been born in the mid-1850s. The Scottish sailor will have been born in the mid-1820s. James Clerk Maxwell, another Scotsman, was his contemporary. He lived from 1831 to 1879.

The British Empire reached its height in 1922, the year Gran was born. The United Kingdom itself was established in 1707, just over a hundred years before the Scottish sailor. Arab Spring has just recently happened in 2011, and demonstrates the power shift from politics to technology.

The first public steam railway was built by George Stephenson in 1825, when the Scottish sailor was born. It is located 77 miles/125 km up the coast from Bridlington. This area has an inspirational history! Before trains, the fastest way to transfer information was by horse.

The electric telegraph was the first step towards long-distance communication as we know it today. Morse demonstrated the New York-Baltimore telegraph line in 1844, just before Gran’s grandfather was born. The zip was invented in 1913, in Arthur’s lifetime.

The Scottish sailor, still remembered, lived 6 generations before my time. 1820 is 170 years ago, with an average generational age of 28 years. Predicting that backwards, we are only 16 generations from the Protestant Reformation. Only 70 generations since the birth of Jesus Christ. That’s only 11 times more than within living memory. This is recent history!

Ancient China’s Warring States period ended in 221 BC. 79 generations. Moses left Egypt in 1446 BC. 122 generations. Abraham was born in 2166 BC. 147 generations. Ancient Egypt formed in 3150 BC. 182 generations. Behavioural modernity in human beings is said to have existed since 50,000 BC. 1835 generations. Anatomically correct human beings are said to have existed since 200,000 BC. 7130 generations.

I’ve heard stories of 6 generations through recent history. The idea that Abraham was born only 25 times as long ago makes it seem very recent. Behaviourally human creatures have only existed since 306 times as long ago, even according to evolutionary theorists. And this doesn’t include a longer lifespan before Genesis 6:3, when each life was limited to 120 years.

Exodus 20:6 – “But I lavish my love on those who love me and obey my commands, even for a thousand generations.” (NLT)
