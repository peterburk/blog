# Tablets and Smartphones

A year later, in summer 2006, I was given another old iBook. The computer still worked, but the trackpad connector was broken off on the motherboard. My brother suggested turning the screen around, and making it a digital picture frame, allowing it to be hung on a wall and display an iPhoto slideshow.

With the leftover parts from my previous repair, I took up the challenge. Using two screen bevels and some plastic mix, I re-routed the screen cables and made my first Mac tablet!

The screen wasn’t touch-sensitive, but I could control it with Salling Clicker from my Pocket PC, an HTC Himalaya. It connected over WiFi and allowed me to remotely control the mouse and keyboard from the smartphone.

At the time, I still used my 2004 model Nokia 5140 as a phone. The Pocket PC was a gift from my dad’s friend, who had bought it on subscription, but was paying extraordinary fees. On the border of France and Switzerland, it was automatically selecting a roaming carrier, and charging him hundreds of Euros to check his email every 5 minutes.

To me, it was a huge upgrade to my free TIME magazine electronic personal organiser. It even had pPod, a virtual iPod! But the SD card capacity was too small to replace my real one, which was by this time a 40 GB iPod Photo.

Even today, there is no hard drive-based iPod Touch. My media collection is now over 100 GB, so I still carry an 80GB iPod alongside my iPhone. As well as the capacity, it ensures my phone battery isn’t flat if I listen to too much music.
