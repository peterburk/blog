# North Korea and Lancaster Leaflets

The summer in Taiwan over, I escaped from my Internet connection yet again, this time in North Korea! It had fascinated me for years that Google Maps leaves the country completely blank. The North Korea Uncovered project, by Google Earth-using students inspired me to find out more about the secretive regime.

Though there is a lack of modern technology available to civilians, the country is able to develop more rapidly with the latest infrastructure, without the need for backwards compatibility. Military presence did not surprise me, since Switzerland requires citizens to do regular military service. The mountains are beautiful, food is delicious, and people are welcoming. It is even very safe, since the government is in such complete control! But the lack of freedom for civilians is restricting innovation outside government priorities, stifling economic growth. Opening overland trade routes between South Korea, China, and Russia could significantly help the country, but are unfortunately not a political priority.

Back in Lancaster, I decided to solve the problem of society events clashing. Rather than having 3 flyers to hand out at once (for the Christian Union, International Café, and International Men’s/Women’s Group), I wanted to create a single, combined calendar of all events, based on the topic. To gather information, I photograph every flyer and poster on campus, sort them by hierarchical category and tag, and post them on a blog.

Over Christmas 2010, I developed LL further, learning how to make iPhone apps using iUI. I wrote an AppleScript to turn my WordPress blog categories into a folder structure of webloc hyperlink files. I then wrote diyUI, a shell script to create the iUI HTML.

LUSARS is also continuing gently, and through it I’ve made trades to upgrade to an iPod Video 5.5G 80GB, which can finally store all my music. I still can’t afford to replace my 160 GB Classic, but am pleased to still have iPodLinux available. All iPods after the 2nd generation Nano (including the Classic) have encrypted firmware, which stifled the project. And with the introduction of iOS devices, the need is reduced.

Usenet was the first web forum, which I mentioned my dad using back in my Digital Native post. Right now, it’s flooded with spam, but can offer the latest news. People currently use computers for reading the news, playing games, and social networking. I have a vision of creating a mobile game to filter the spam on Usenet, which could bring the site back as a topic-based open access forum. Much less cliquey than Facebook, which biases those with more friends. I’d like to create this app, possibly in the 2 months between my last exam and graduation.

I also believe that Google Earth is the future of information management. International organisations such as the UN deal with a huge number of documents, relevant for different areas at different times. Organising that database is another project I’d like to complete.
