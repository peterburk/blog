# Enter The iPod

I have a desire to push technology to its limits. With all the free disk space on my iBook, how was I going to fill it? Napster was brand new, and offered a huge range of music far beyond what local shops could provide. Downloading introduced me to many bands I would never have heard of otherwise. But it was too slow to get a whole album, so I still bought CDs.

Without a CD writer, I could rip and mix, but not burn. I didn’t have a Discman, so I had to transfer the songs in real time to my MiniDisc player.

But at Christmas in the year 2000, the digital music revolution began. Diamond released the Rio 600, a 32 MB MP3 player. It connected via USB, and could transfer the One More Time single by Daft Punk straight from SoundJam MP to my pocket.

By summer 2001, I got quite tired of the 8 songs on my Rio, and the MiniDisc player saw some final use while on holiday. That November, everything changed again. Apple announced the iPod, with a whopping 5 GB of disk space. And it could fit in a pocket, unlike Creative’s Nomad Jukebox.

We were travelling over the holiday and missed the first shipment to arrive at our local Apple reseller, which sold out within a week. But my brother and I reserved the first two of the second shipment. One cold night in February 2002, my father drove us down to the shop, and my carefully-saved pocket money was no more.

I owned an iPod.

Fortunately, we had bought the iMac DV rather than the Bondi Blue. It was the first model with FireWire, and compatible with our new iPods. Transfer speeds were astonishing – all my music was transferred in under 10 minutes!

At school, both I and my iPod were teased for its stupid name. But it meant a lot to me, especially when I could block out the rejection with white earbuds. I finally had an escape route from loneliness.

Although the original Mac OS X Public Beta was released on my birthday in 2000, it wasn’t until 10.1 in 2001 that I switched from OS 9. But I never went back. The Aqua interface brought colour and gloss to the Mac, which might have put off serious business users, but attracted me. The interface changes to Brushed Metal and Polished Metal have followed my own maturing over the years.

At home, WiFi brought with it MSN Messenger. Useful, but I needed new friends from outside school. I joined NorthStar Academy, an online school, for an extra GCSE in Religious Studies. Suddenly, my typing skills improved dramatically! The incentive to type faster was not Mavis Beacon, but girls around the world willing to talk to me! People worry that computers harm social development – I can testify that they did the opposite for me. With the confidence I gained online, I had more courage to talk to people in person.
