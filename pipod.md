# The Original PiPod

I would like to announce the Original PiPod!

This is a serious case mod, for experienced modders.

The iPodLinux team (of which I was a forum moderator) put Linux on the iPod. I now put Linux in this iPod!

It is an original first-generation iPod, bought broken on eBay for 50 CHF = $55. When I discovered that the motherboard was water-damaged, I left it in a drawer, and only got it out again last week.

My working original iPod, which I have owned since February 2002, wasn’t so impressed.

Some other historic devices are pleased to see it, however :).

It now fits inside iPod cases, such as the Speck iGuy!

I am using it to share the files of my iPod (with a 240GB hard drive upgrade) over WiFi to my iPhone.

I have another project idea. I would like to use the published Raspberry Pi schematic (https://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Raspberry-Pi-Schematics-R1.0.pdf) to build a Raspberry Pi clone with a dock connector. I would then use my 5-in-1 camera connection kit for the ports – AV, SD, microSD, miniUSB power, and USB host.
If someone would like to write a business plan with me and submit this idea to Kickstarter, I am interested!

Another Kickstarter idea is simply an iPod-compatible case. It wouldn’t be a PiPod, but if we buy in bulk, we can ask the supplier to populate alternative connectors onto the Raspberry Pi. Then we just build a case that fits other iPod belt clips, etc. If you would like to write a business plan with me, email me at peterburk@gmail.com!
