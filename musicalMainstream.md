# Enter The iPod

As time wore on, the insults at school ended. The iPod went from an object of mockery to an icon of respect. In summer 2003, I upgraded to the 3rd generation iPod. It introduced the dock connector with USB support, making it possible to sync directly from my iBook. It also provided 30 GB of disk space, a welcome relief from my rapidly-filling 5 GB!

Once my 1st generation iPod’s warranty had expired, I was fascinated by its internals. So I took a screwdriver, and pried open the back case. Back in those days, Apple devices were still that simple to disassemble. So when Liz, a friend from church, told me she’d broken her 4th generation iPod screen, I happily offered to take it apart for her.

While I couldn’t repair the cracked LCD at the time, it was a few months later that Natalie had broken her iPod’s hard drive. By now Liz had lost all hope in resurrecting her iPod, so I was able to buy it from her for only 40 CHF. I could then fit the disk into Natalie’s, and my iPod repair business began.

That was not my only interest in the iPod, however. I joined the iPodLinux project in 2003, and participated so actively in the web forum that I was appointed a moderator. My development was relatively minor, since I didn’t know C at the time, but I happily answered questions, filtered spam, disciplined trolls, and calmed flame wars.

I was also teaching myself AppleScript, a high-level scripting language providing an API into every Mac program. At first I was coding HTML parsers, downloading eBooks from several websites. I wrote a script to copy my daily Bible reading onto my iPod, using the new Notes feature. As well as finding the chapters to read from a preferences file, it split the text into 1000-character pages, with hyperlinks between. Although it was never heavily used by others, it taught me a lot about programming.
