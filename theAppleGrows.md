# The Apple Grows

My upbringing introduced me to computers from a young age. But what would I do with this knowledge? Until I was 8 years old I still shared a family computer, a Macintosh LC III. I remember learning to type on the Apple Keyboard II, and learning to use the original ADB Mouse. Printing documents on our Personal LaserWriter 320, and later on the Colour StyleWriter 2400. But because my family would use it, my computer time was limited. It was still a tool, not a way of life. At the time, I was passionate about space, so would use it to draw rocket designs.

The difference came when my dad found an abandoned Macintosh Plus left out for scrap. It was older than me! He brought it home, and it became my very own computer. I didn’t like the long travel on the keyboard or the old-fashioned mouse, but I could use this computer for as long as I wanted.

My primary school used the same model for teaching us LogoWriter. Many a break time passed as I went from drawing cubes to snowflakes, music, and even basic animations. When I got my Mac Plus, I would use an 800KB DD floppy disk to transfer my work to and from school each day. We had a typing class, which I thought a waste of time – I already knew how to type!

The school later replaced their old computers. Having discovered the joy of having my very own, I got permission to bring many of them home. I stored them in the attic, and brought them all back to working order. I found a security flaw in At Ease allowing me full access to the System 7.5 installed, an improvement to the System 7.0.1 on my Mac Plus. Since then, I’ve enjoyed expanding my collection, and using it to rescue documents stored on old SCSI hard drives or floppy disks unreadable on newer machines.
