# UCSB and HealthDiplomats

My second year of university was spent on exchange in UC Santa Barbara. Lancaster had taught me basic Maths, Mechanical and Electronic Engineering. UCSB instead taught classes in processor design, network architecture, and entrepreneurship. This was where I belonged.

Google Earth also began to interest me. Having written an AppleScript to export my Facebook contacts to Address Book, I wrote another to place them on a map. Just like Where I’ve Been, but back in Christmas 2008, and before the Facebook API was opened up.

Collecting computers is more difficult when you haven’t anywhere to store them. But when I was offered a PowerMac G3 Blue & White, I recognised it as the bridge machine between SCSI and FireWire, ADB and USB, and couldn’t refuse. In the same way, when I was offered a Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh, although it wasn’t much use apart from as Bose speakers, I didn’t want to let it go. Both are now with my friend Jordan Genack in San Diego.

Perhaps my most useful Axiotron program was QuickFlip, a screen rotator. Although I didn’t have a Modbook, it was still useful for reading PDFs in portrait mode. I could lie down and read, or use the wrist rests for taking notes. To this day, I still use that program to rotate my screen for my daily Bible reading. It has a backlight, I can look up definitions more easily, and is already in my bag.

So is the age of paper ending? Yes, but technology must progress further. While screen rotators and iPads allow books to be read more easily, notes are still best taken on paper. Writing is faster than typing, even for me. Maybe a Modbook could have changed that, but unfortunately I can’t afford one.

My next summer job was HealthDiplomats, back in Switzerland. While I spent a long time proofreading and organising documents, my AppleScript skills came in useful yet again. I wrote several to help organise contacts in Address Book, and continued my Google Earth map creation. During that summer, I made the World Visas spreadsheet and maps, available for download on this website. I also described an SMS-based system for automatic pandemic alerts, using contact information for local doctors from MedPages. Sadly, AfMobile has not yet been developed any further.
