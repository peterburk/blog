# iBook Repair

I still remembered my times on the Mac Plus. So when I saw a Macintosh Quadra in the hallway at my secondary school in the summer of 2005, I started asking questions. Was it being thrown away? Could I take it home? To my great pleasure, I could! What’s more, I was introduced to Paul O’Donnell, the responsible for the primary school’s iBook collection. He was upgrading, and throwing away a class set!

The school weren’t willing for me to have 20 iBooks for free though, even though they were 4 years old. So I found 14 buyers, borrowed 1500 CHF from my parents, and bought them. Within two weeks, I’d diagnosed, disassembled, and rebuilt 15 working iBooks!

Although the profit was only small, I ended up with a white iBook Dual USB, and repaired my original iBook, which had sadly broken, forcing me to use my dad’s PowerBook and an iMac for a year.

More significantly, I could finally sync my iPod on my own computer over FireWire! Although I’d had a taste of the speed on the old iMac DV, I switched to syncing over USB with my 3rd generation iPod, since I could manage my music library on my own laptop.
